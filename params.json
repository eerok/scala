These improvements make the compiler faster and the emitted code more compact.\r\n\r\nThe delta with respect to `scalac` and a breakdown of the changes introduced are covered in:\r\n - https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/compare/master...GenRefactored74\r\n - https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/N1wnQcjcDvk/bnxrAQMxSsQJ (this post contains URLs to commits superseded above, but the high-level description remains accurate).\r\n\r\nTo get up and running, please skip to [Getting Started](#GettingStarted).\r\n\r\n## 1.1 Why a new optimizer\r\n\r\n> Aren't _next-silver-bullet_ going to give us top performance, with zero effort required from us?\r\n\r\nThe experimental optimizer instead:\r\n* improves performance today (you know, just in case method handles in JDK 7 remain slow and buggy, for lack of backporting LambdaForm fixes from JDK 8)\r\n* while leaving a door open to future developments (closures via method handles are _also_ optimized)\r\n* consisting of many focused, individually simple, transformations; that are combined to implement bytecode-level refactorings, using ASM http://asm.ow2.org/\r\n\r\n## 1.2 And a faster code emitter, too\r\n\r\nBefore the new optimizer runs (`GenBCodeOpt`) the new bytecode emitter (`GenBCode`) turns Abstract Syntax Trees directly into ASM Trees, outperforming by 30% its existing counterpart (`GenICode + GenASM`).\r\n- the intermediate step to build Control Flow Graphs is not needed,\r\n- disk writing and class file building overlap (the more source files, the larger the speedup)\r\n\r\n## 1.3 Leaner Closure ASTs\r\n\r\nThe release version of `scalac` processes closures by creating inner classes early in the compilation pipeline (the \"traditional\" approach to closure conversion). Instead, the new backend postpones the creation of AST nodes for closures, simplifying the job of specialization, erasure, and other compiler phases. \r\n\r\nUnder \"modern\" closure conversion, the  bytecode emitter takes responsibility for producing the JVM-level representation of closures. This is the default (compiler option `-closurify:delegating` ).\r\n\r\n# <a name=\"WhatsNew\">2</a> What's new in the new optimizer\r\n\r\n## 2.1 Distinction between intra-program and cross-library optimizations\r\n\r\nThe existing inliner, once activated, will inline both callees found in external libraries (against which the program is being compiled) as well as callees in the program being compiled. There's no way to tell it to focus only in the intra-program case. The advantage of applying intra-program optimizations only is that at runtime updated libraries may be used (granted, binary compatible ones).\r\n\r\nThe new optimizer associates `-neo:o2` with \"intra-program optimizations\" and `-neo:o3` with \"cross-libraries optimizations\", as discussed in more detail in Sec. 4.1.\r\n\r\n## 2.2 Inlining\r\n\r\nThe inliner currently used in scalac has a few problems:\r\n\r\n* closure elimination is implemented as repeated method inlinings. Upon being forced to stop with that (e.g., recursive method) none of the previous inlinings is undone, leaving both the closure class and a trail of duplicate code.\r\n* code may be inlined from third-party libraries or the JDK. In general methods not marked `@inline` may be inlined as discussed in thread [the perils of inlining](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-internals/uyFWFRbUD0o/discussion) \r\n* invocation cycles (ie M1() calling M2() calling M1() etc) are \"broken\" only after hitting the maximum method size threshold, leaving a trail of duplicate code behind.\r\n\r\nInstead, the experimental optimizer just follows a simple principle:\r\n\r\n> only inline @inline-marked methods, and always inline them, including under separate-compilation\r\n\r\nThus the new inliner is deterministic, not dependent on heuristics about method sizes or similar. The only additional requirement (if you will) is that the method to dispatch (the one marked `@inline`) can be found via the static type of the receiver, e.g. in a `Range.foreach()` callsite the type of the receiver must be `Range` or subtype (in general, not a super type where the `@inline` method is defined). After all, inlining is a conscious decision: making that explicit via the type of the receiver is straightforward. As a result, the `@noinline` annotation doesn't play a role anymore.\r\n\r\nThe new optimizer provides detailed logging about performed inlinings, as well as diagnostics when inlining proves unfeasible (down to the culprit bytecode instructions). With that, fixing the causes of non-inlining takes way less effort, as the following shows.\r\n\r\nLog example:\r\n\r\n    [log jvm] Successful closure-inlining (albeit null receiver couldn't be ruled out). Callsite: \r\n      scala/tools/nsc/Global.exitingTyper(Lscala/Function0;)Ljava/lang/Object;\r\n    occurring in method\r\n      scala/tools/nsc/interpreter/JLineCompletion$CompilerCompletion$class::memberNamed(Lscala/tools/nsc/interpreter/JLineCompletion$CompilerCompletion;Ljava/lang/String;)Lscala/reflect/internal/Symbols$Symbol;\r\n\r\n\r\nWarning example:\r\n\r\n    SpecializeTypes.scala:1166: warning: Closure-inlining failed because\r\n      scala/collection/immutable/List::mapConserve(Lscala/Function1;)Lscala/collection/immutable/List;\r\n    contains instruction \r\n      INVOKESPECIAL scala/collection/immutable/List.loop$1 (Lscala/collection/mutable/ListBuffer;Lscala/collection/immutable/List;Lscala/collection/immutable/List;Lscala/Function1;)Lscala/collection/immutable/List;\r\n    that would cause IllegalAccessError from class scala/tools/nsc/transform/SpecializeTypes\r\n            val parents1 = parents mapConserve specializedType\r\n                                   ^\r\n\r\nThe warning makes sense: `loop()` is a local method:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n// scala.collection.immutable.List\r\n  @inline final def mapConserve[B >: A <: AnyRef](f: A => B): List[B] = {\r\n    @tailrec\r\n    def loop(mapped: ListBuffer[B], unchanged: List[A], pending: List[A]): List[B] =\r\n       ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe bytecode-level counterpart, `loop$1()`, was emitted as private, as javap output shows:\r\n\r\n```javap\r\nprivate final\r\nscala.collection.immutable.List\r\nloop$1(scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer,\r\n       scala.collection.immutable.List,\r\n       scala.collection.immutable.List,\r\n       scala.Function1);\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2.3 GC-savvy closures: Singleton closures, Minimization of closure state\r\n\r\nSome anonymous closures depend only on `apply()` arguments, for example the char filter function:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n  def deeplyNestedMethod(str: String) = {\r\n    str filter {\r\n      (char: Char) =>\r\n        (char >= 'a' && char <= 'f') ||\r\n        (char >= 'A' && char <= 'F') ||\r\n        (char >= '0' && char <= '9') }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn these cases, the new optimizer avoids repeated allocations by keeping (in a static field) a singleton-instance that is reused.\r\n\r\nAfter dead-code elimination, closure state comprises only what is actually accessed.\r\n\r\nThese features are more useful on Android (besides micro-benchmarks) where a vast RAM doesn't masquerade redundant allocations.\r\n\r\n## 2.4 Supported optimizations\r\n\r\n### 2.4.1 Intra-method optimizations\r\n\r\n* collapse a multi-jump chain to target its final destination via a single jump\r\n* remove unreachable code\r\n* remove those LabelNodes and LineNumbers that aren't in use\r\n* remove dangling exception handlers\r\n* copy propagation\r\n* dead-store elimination\r\n* Preserve side-effects, but remove those (producer, consumer) pairs where the consumer is a DROP and\r\n  the producer has its value consumed only by the DROP in question.\r\n* simplify branches that need not be taken to get to their destination.\r\n* nullness propagation\r\n* constant folding\r\n* caching repeatable reads of stable values\r\n* eliding box/unbox pairs\r\n* eliding redundant local vars\r\n\r\n\r\n### 2.4.2 Intra-class optimizations\r\n\r\n* those private members of a class which see no use are elided\r\n* tree-shake unused closures, minimize the fields of those remaining\r\n* minimization of closure-allocations\r\n* refresh the InnerClasses JVM attribute\r\n\r\n### 2.4.3 Whole-program optimizations\r\n\r\n* method inlining\r\n* closure inlining\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# <a name=\"TestDriving\">3</a> Test driving the new optimizer\r\n\r\n## 3.1 How much does it add to compilation time?\r\n\r\nThe new optimizer (except the whole-program step) is task-parallel:\r\n* intra-method optimizations are run in parallel for different methods;\r\n* intra-class optimizations are run parallel for different classes\r\n\r\nVisually:\r\n\r\n![experimental optimizer uses task parallelism](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~magarcia/ScalaCompilerCornerReloaded/yk.png)\r\n\r\nThere's no reason to limit the worker pool to 8 threads, that's \"configurable\" at:\r\n\r\n```scala\r\n    val MAX_THREADS = scala.math.min(\r\n      32,\r\n      java.lang.Runtime.getRuntime.availableProcessors\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3.2 Emitted code size\r\n\r\nLet's take scala/scala as case study, compiling src/compiler and src/reflect (on the one hand) and the standard library (on the other) using:\r\n\r\n1. GenICode and GenASM.\r\n2. GenBCode (highlighted).\r\n\r\nThe new optimizer produces smaller JARs:\r\n\r\n![jar size comparison](http://lampwww.epfl.ch/~magarcia/ScalaCompilerCornerReloaded/SizeComparison.png)\r\n\r\nThe above reflects not so much code reductions (in terms of instruction count) but smaller constant pools due to Lean Closure Classes (an LCC just delegates to the class where the anon-closure is instantiated, which usually already has the constant pool entries that under \"traditional\" closure conversion have to be duplicated in the anon-closure-class).\r\n\r\nTo benefit from code size reductions as well, `-neo:o1` (intra-method optimizations) or up will do the trick. Moreover, on a multicore `-neo:o1` doesn't increase appreciably compilation time, I'm actually thinking making it default.\r\n\r\nFor example, method `driver()` in `test/files/run/t7181.scala` results in:\r\n* 881 instructions, when compiled with `-neo:o2 -closurify:delegating`\r\n* 1004 instructions, when compiled with `-neo:GenASM -closurify:traditional -optimise` (actually, `-optimise` increases code size, but the comparison with `-neo:o2` is fair).\r\n\r\nThat's 881 vs 1004 instructions and not bytes, which still matters in case you're the one who has to read 881 vs 1004 lines of javap output.\r\n\r\n## 3.3 Benchmarks\r\n\r\nFeedback is welcome!\r\n\r\n## 3.4 Speeding up scalac\r\n\r\nSpeedups in the range 10% to 20% have been observed against the latest `scalac`. The upper range is achieved by having a compiler optimized by the new optimizer compile using `-neo:GenBCode -closurify:delegating` (ie unoptimized compilation, using the new bytecode emitter and Leaner Closure ASTs). Just one data point:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[stopwatch] [locker.comp.timer: 1:43.359 sec]\r\n...\r\n[stopwatch] [quick.comp.timer:  1:32.335 sec]\r\n```\r\n\r\nRight now the new optimizer alone makes scalac only marginally faster. Instead, the 15% speedup mentioned above is due to the compiler doing less work: (a) Leaner Closure ASTs, (b) the new bytecode emitter, and (c) lower GC overhead. That's normal: `scalac` is dominated by factors not optimizable (at least not in the short term). Examples abound: \r\n* millions of `::` allocated. Neither the old nor the new optimizer are tuned to reduce that.\r\n* for deeper insights:  https://github.com/gkossakowski/scalac-aspects\r\n* actually, tools like Caliper or ScalaMeter, by themselves, tell how much faster sthg runs. When building an optimizer, it's more useful to know \"why\" stgh runs faster (specially with 20+ optimizations at play). With some work, the toolset that Grzegorz has jumpstarted can provide those insights. \r\n\r\nThe new optimizer may well make *your* code run faster. To find out, give it a try.\r\n\r\n## 3.5 Bugs fixed\r\n\r\n* [SI-5850](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-5850) Inlined code shouldn't forget null-check on the original receiver\r\n* [SI-5950](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-5950) Inlining creates duplicates when anon-closure-class can't be eliminated after all\r\n* [SI-6288](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-6288) Wrong line number information in bytecode\r\n* [SI-6546](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-6546) Optimizer leaves references to classes that have been eliminated by inlining \r\n* [SI-6759](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-6759) Seek clarification about necessary and sufficient conditions for inclusion in InnerClasses JVM attribute \r\n* [SI-7407](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-7407) return inside try + pattern-match inside finally causes VerifyError\r\n* [SI-7540](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-7540) Optimizer changes behavior when pattern matching Some(X) scrutinee when X's type assumed wrong\r\n* [SI-7560](https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-7560) the ICode optimizer doesn't DCE-away trivial branches \r\n* all `ICodeReader` bugs (not used anymore)\r\n\r\n\r\n# <a name=\"GettingStarted\">4</a> Getting Started\r\n\r\nThe first step is checking out branch `GenRefactored74` of repository https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone git://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala.git GenRefactored74\r\ncd GenRefactored74\r\ngit checkout -b GenRefactored74 origin/GenRefactored74\r\nant all.clean && ant\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## 4.0 Using sbt to build your project with the new backend / optimizer\r\n\r\nSection [Using Scala from a local directory](http://www.scala-sbt.org/snapshot/docs/Detailed-Topics/Configuring-Scala.html) covers the changes needed in your project's `Build.scala`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nscalaVersion := \"2.11.0-SNAPSHOT\",\r\n\r\nscalaHome := Some(file(\"scala-with-new-backend/build/pack\")),\r\n   \r\nscalacOptions ++= Seq( . . . your options\r\n                      \"-neo:o3\", // the highest level of the new optimizer\r\n                       . . . more of your options\r\n                     ),\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere \"scala-with-new-backend\" is the folder one gets after  following the steps in the sub-section above (cloning, checking out branch `GenRefactored74`, building the compiler with `ant`).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## 4.1 Meaning of optimization levels\r\n\r\nEach optimization level includes all optimizations from lower levels, and assume the new bytecode emitter (`GenBCode`) is active:\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n    <tr> <td><code>-neo:GenASM</code></td>   <td>backdoor to use the old backend.</td> </tr>\r\n    <tr> <td><code>-neo:GenBCode</code></td> <td>use the new code emitter, just emitting trees as delivered by CleanUp</td> </tr>\r\n    <tr> <td><code>-neo:o1</code></td>       <td>Intra-method optimizations and all closure optimizations except closure stack-allocation (in detail: <code>-neo:o1</code> performs minimization of closure state and closure \"singletonization\")</td> </tr>\r\n    <tr> <td><code>-neo:o2</code></td>       <td>Intra-program optimizations. This includes any method inlining and closure stack-allocation </em>as long as</em> it affects only what's being compiled, as opposed to peeking inside external libraries (see below).</td> </tr>\r\n    <tr> <td><code>-neo:o3</code></td>       <td>Cross-libraries optimization: this includes the same kinds of optimization as above, with the caveat that bytecode from external <em>can be parsed</em> if needed to apply some optimization (e.g., this is the optimization level to picks to have <code>Range.foreach</code> inlined)</td> </tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n*Nota bene*: In order to ease migration from old to new optimizer, for now no error is emitted when mixing compiler flags for old and new optimizer. In this case the compiler silently falls back to the old optimizer. This \"feature\" allows keeping the test suite as is: all those tests asking for `-optimise` or one of its variants can run without modification.\r\n\r\n\r\n## 4.2 Choosing bytecode-level representation of closures\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><code>-closurify:traditional</code></td>   <td>Good ol' dedicated inner class for each closure.

In fact, the compiler used to compile the new backend doesn't understand (yet) about `-neo:o1` and such flags. The following steps are needed to overcome all that:\r\n\r\nFirst, update `build.xml` to the desired level of optimization:\r\n\r\n```\r\n-      <antcall target=\"@{name}\"><param name=\"scalac.args.optimise\" value=\"-optimise\"/></antcall>\r\n+      <antcall target=\"@{name}\"><param name=\"scalac.args.optimise\" value=\"-neo:o3\"/></antcall>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecond, `ant all.clean && ant && ant replacelocker && ant nightly`\r\n\r\nThe console will show something like:\r\n```\r\ninit:\r\n     . . . \r\n     [echo]       scalac args: -Yreify-copypaste  -neo:o1\r\n     [echo] scalac quick args: -Yreify-copypaste  -neo:o1 \r\n     . . . \r\n```\r\nThe nightly build takes from 80 minutes to 2 hours, depending on hardware.\r\n\r\n## 5.2 Experimental features\r\n\r\n### 5.2.1 \"really static\" value classes and static modules\r\n\r\n> Given there's some overlap in functionality with another proposal,\r\n> https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2416\r\n> each with pros and cons, for now \"really static\" lives in an older branch, `GenRefactored39`\r\n\r\nBefore `@enforceStatic`, functionality defined on objects (and in the companion to value-classes) was accessed following the idiom:\r\n```\r\n  load singleton-module\r\n  invokevirtual(arg1 ... argN)\r\n```\r\nAfter JIT-compilation, performance is great because there's a single method method implementation to dispatch.\r\n\r\nHowever the above can be expressed more succinctly with \"really static\" methods, with corresponding invokestatic callistes. This is what the @enforceStatic annotation allows, when applied to: \r\n  - static module (ie an object definition that lacks outer instance) \r\n  - value class.\r\n\r\nIn case the compiler can't honor the request for really-static-ness, a descriptive error message is shown. This can happen in two situations:\r\n\r\nFirst, upon extending another class:\r\n```\r\n  @enforceStatic\r\n  case class Valued(val repr: Int) extends AnyVal {\r\n    def odd = (repr&1)==1\r\n  }\r\n\r\n   error: Won't statify the static module class of Valued because it has a superClass other than AnyRef: scala.runtime.AbstractFunction1\r\n  case class Valued(val repr: Int) extends AnyVal {\r\n             ^\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecond, upon extending non-marker interfaces: For example, a value-class that `extends AnyVal with Serializable` is ok, but extending an interface that declares one or more members results in an error for an @enforceStatic-tagged class.\r\n\r\nMore defails (and examples) in the documentation of `scala.enforceStatic`\r\nhttps://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/blob/GenRefactored39/src/library/scala/enforceStatic.scala\r\n\r\n\r\n### 5.2.2 Method handles\r\n\r\nIn principle, method handles can help with specialization, structural types, and anonymous closure classes. The prototype in branch `GenMHv3` puts MHs to work to replace anon-closure-classes, with mixed results (the good: smaller jars; the bad: performance on JDK7). For perspective, the delta with respect to the non-MethodHandles backend is: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/compare/magarciaEPFL:GenRefactored14...GenMHv3\r\n\r\nSources can be obtained via:\r\n```\r\n    git clone git://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala.git GenMHv3\r\n    cd GenMHv3\r\n    git checkout -b GenMHv3 origin/GenMHv3\r\n    ant all.clean && ant\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis prototype requires `-target:jvm-1.7`. Right now scalac doesn't produce the newest class file format of JDK8. In the meantime,  `-target:jvm-1.7` can be used on that platform. A discussion about performance at: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scala-internals/uBxprJixpwk/jG78X1k_92IJ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# <a name=\"FAQ\">6</a> FAQ\r\n\r\n* **What are those Java sources doing in package `scala.tools.asm.optimiz`?** \r\n\r\nThose Java classes are a thin layer of functionality on top of the ASM library, which is written in Java. Package `scala.tools.asm.optimiz` contains intra-method optimizations which can be performed without knowledge about Scala-level types. The bulk of the optimizer, in constrast, is written in Scala.\r\n\r\n* **If MethodHandles are slow on JDK7, how come other programming languages are happily using them?**\r\n\r\nThere's no contradiction. Other languages use MethodHandles for what Scala would accomplish via structural types, and in that setting MHs are faster than Java reflection. Instead, the prototype described in Sec. 5.2.2 leverages MHs in an area far more important to Scala (anonymous closures), and in that setting they don't outperform the (optimized) Lean Closure Classes that the new backend emits. Admittedly, more work is needed, as described in Sec. 5.2.2.\r\n\r\n* **What about tests?**\r\n\r\nAs Sec. 5.1 shows, the test suite passes under all optimization levels, from `-neo:GenBCode` to `-neo:o1` through `-neo:o3`. It's always possible to include additional tests, for a correct optimizer: _they will also pass!_ Thus if you are not convinced about the correctness argument, how about finding counter-examples? If you find one, please post it at scala-internals for discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# <a name=\"FeedbackWelcome\">7</a> Comments, benchmarks, test cases, bug reports, are welcome.\r\n\r\nPlease help us help you.
