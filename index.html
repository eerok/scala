<p>The experimental branch <code>GenRefactored58</code> bundles improvements in three areas: optimizer, code emitter, and AST-level representation of closures. These improvements make the compiler faster and the emitted code more compact.</p>

<p>The delta with respect to <code>scalac</code> and a breakdown of the changes introduced are covered in:</p>

<ul>

</ul><p>To get up and running, please skip to Section 4 (Getting Started).</p>

<h2>1.1 Why a new optimizer</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Aren't <em>next-silver-bullet</em> going to give us top performance, with zero effort required from us?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The experimental optimizer instead:</p>

<ul>
<li>improves performance today (you know, just in case method handles in JDK 7 remain slow and buggy, for lack of backporting LambdaForm fixes from JDK 8)</li>
<li>while leaving a door open to future developments (closures via method handles are <em>also</em> optimized)</li>
<li>consisting of many focused, individually simple, transformations; that are combined to implement bytecode-level refactorings, using ASM <a href="http://asm.ow2.org/">http://asm.ow2.org/</a>
</li>
</ul><h2>1.2 And a faster code emitter, too</h2>

<p>Before the new optimizer runs (<code>GenBCodeOpt</code>) the new bytecode emitter (<code>GenBCode</code>) turns Abstract Syntax Trees directly into ASM Trees, outperforming by 30% its existing counterpart (<code>GenICode + GenASM</code>).</p>

<ul>
<li>the intermediate step to build Control Flow Graphs is not needed,</li>
<li>disk writing and class file building overlap (the more source files, the larger the speedup)</li>
</ul><h2>1.3 Leaner Closure ASTs</h2>

<p>The release version of <code>scalac</code> processes closures by creating inner classes early in the compilation pipeline (the "traditional" approach to closure conversion). Instead, the new backend postpones the creation of AST nodes for closures, simplifying the job of specialization, erasure, and other compiler phases. </p>

<p>Under "modern" closure conversion, the  bytecode emitter takes responsibility for producing the JVM-level representation of closures. The implementation-level representation can be chosen between:</p>

<ul>
<li>inner classes, when using <code>-closurify:delegating</code> (yes, like under <code>-closurify:traditional</code>, with the big difference that additional optimizations are applicable).</li>
<li>JSR-292 Method Handles, when using <code>-closurify:MH</code> as described in more detail in the following subsection.</li>
</ul><h2>1.4 "really static" value classes and static modules</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Given there's some overlap in functionality with another proposal,
<a href="https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2416">https://github.com/scala/scala/pull/2416</a>
each with pros and cons, for now "really static" lives in an older branch, <code>GenRefactored39</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before <code>@enforceStatic</code>, functionality defined on objects (and in the companion to value-classes) was accessed following the idiom:</p>

<pre><code>  load singleton-module
  invokevirtual(arg1 ... argN)
</code></pre>

<p>After JIT-compilation, performance is great because there's a single method method implementation to dispatch.</p>

<p>However the above can be expressed more succinctly with "really static" methods, with corresponding invokestatic callistes. This is what the @enforceStatic annotation allows, when applied to: </p>

<ul>
<li>static module (ie an object definition that lacks outer instance) </li>
<li>value class.</li>
</ul><p>In case the compiler can't honor the request for really-static-ness, a descriptive error message is shown. This can happen in two situations:</p>

<p>First, upon extending another class:</p>

<pre><code>  @enforceStatic
  case class Valued(val repr: Int) extends AnyVal {
    def odd = (repr&amp;1)==1
  }

   error: Won't statify the static module class of Valued because it has a superClass other than AnyRef: scala.runtime.AbstractFunction1
  case class Valued(val repr: Int) extends AnyVal {
             ^
</code></pre>

<p>Second, upon extending non-marker interfaces: For example, a value-class that <code>extends AnyVal with Serializable</code> is ok, but extending an interface that declares one or more members results in an error for an @enforceStatic-tagged class.</p>

<p>More defails (and examples) in the documentation of <code>scala.enforceStatic</code>
<a href="https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/blob/GenRefactored39/src/library/scala/enforceStatic.scala">https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/blob/GenRefactored39/src/library/scala/enforceStatic.scala</a></p>

<h2>1.5 Method handles</h2>

<p>In principle, method handles can help with specialization, structural types, and anonymous closure classes. The prototype in branch <code>GenMHv3</code> puts MHs to work to replace anon-closure-classes, with mixed results (the good: smaller jars; the bad: performance on JDK7). For perspective, the delta with respect to the non-MethodHandles backend is: </p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/compare/magarciaEPFL:GenRefactored14...GenMHv3">https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/compare/magarciaEPFL:GenRefactored14...GenMHv3</a></p>

<p>Sources can be obtained via:</p>

<pre><code>    git clone git://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala.git GenMHv3
    cd GenMHv3
    git checkout -b GenMHv3 origin/GenMHv3
    ant all.clean &amp;&amp; ant
</code></pre>

<p>This prototype requires <code>-target:jvm-1.7</code>. Right now scalac doesn't produce the newest class file format of JDK8. In the meantime,  <code>-target:jvm-1.7</code> can be used on that platform.

<h1>2 What's new in the new optimizer</h1>

<h2>2.1 Distinction between intra-program and cross-library optimizations</h2>

<p>The existing inliner, once activated, will inline both callees found in external libraries (against which the program is being compiled) as well as callees in the program being compiled. There's no way to tell it to focus only in the intra-program case. The advantage of applying intra-program optimizations only is that at runtime updated libraries may be used (granted, binary compatible ones).</p>

<p>The new optimizer associates <code>-neo:o2</code> with "intra-program optimizations" and <code>-neo:o3</code> with "cross-libraries optimizations", as discussed in more detail in Sec. 4.1.</p>

<h2>2.2 Inlining</h2>

<p>The inliner currently used in scalac has a few problems:</p>

<ul>
<li>closure elimination is implemented as repeated method inlinings. Upon being forced to stop with that (e.g., recursive method) none of the previous inlinings is undone, leaving both the closure class and a trail of duplicate code.</li>
<li>code may be inlined from third-party libraries or the JDK. In general methods not marked <code>@inline</code> may be inlined as discussed in thread <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/topic/scala-internals/uyFWFRbUD0o/discussion">the perils of inlining</a> </li>
<li>invocation cycles (ie M1() calling M2() calling M1() etc) are "broken" only after hitting the maximum method size threshold, leaving a trail of duplicate code behind.</li>
</ul><p>Instead, the experimental optimizer just follows a simple principle:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>only inline @inline-marked methods, and always inline them, including under separate-compilation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus the new inliner is deterministic, not dependent on heuristics about method sizes or similar. The only additional requirement (if you will) is that the method to dispatch (the one marked <code>@inline</code>) can be found via the static type of the receiver, e.g. in a <code>Range.foreach()</code> callsite the type of the receiver must be <code>Range</code> or subtype (in general, not a super type where the <code>@inline</code> method is defined). After all, inlining is a conscious decision: making that explicit via the type of the receiver is straightforward. As a result, the <code>@noinline</code> annotation doesn't play a role anymore.</p>

<p>The new optimizer provides detailed logging about performed inlinings, as well as diagnostics when inlining proves unfeasible (down to the culprit bytecode instructions). With that, fixing the causes of non-inlining takes way less effort, as the following shows.</p>

<p>Log example:</p>

<pre><code>[log jvm] Successful closure-inlining (albeit null receiver couldn't be ruled out). Callsite: 
  scala/tools/nsc/Global.exitingTyper(Lscala/Function0;)Ljava/lang/Object;
occurring in method
  scala/tools/nsc/interpreter/JLineCompletion$CompilerCompletion$class::memberNamed(Lscala/tools/nsc/interpreter/JLineCompletion$CompilerCompletion;Ljava/lang/String;)Lscala/reflect/internal/Symbols$Symbol;
</code></pre>

<p>Warning example:</p>

<pre><code>SpecializeTypes.scala:1166: warning: Closure-inlining failed because
  scala/collection/immutable/List::mapConserve(Lscala/Function1;)Lscala/collection/immutable/List;
contains instruction 
  INVOKESPECIAL scala/collection/immutable/List.loop$1 (Lscala/collection/mutable/ListBuffer;Lscala/collection/immutable/List;Lscala/collection/immutable/List;Lscala/Function1;)Lscala/collection/immutable/List;
that would cause IllegalAccessError from class scala/tools/nsc/transform/SpecializeTypes
        val parents1 = parents mapConserve specializedType
                               ^
</code></pre>

<p>The warning makes sense: <code>loop()</code> is a local method:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c1">// scala.collection.immutable.List</span>
  <span class="nd">@inline</span> <span class="k">final</span> <span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">mapConserve</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="kt">B</span> <span class="k">&gt;:</span> <span class="kt">A</span> <span class="k">&lt;:</span> <span class="kt">AnyRef</span><span class="o">](</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">A</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">B</span><span class="o">)</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">List</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="kt">B</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="nd">@tailrec</span>
    <span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">loop</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">mapped</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">ListBuffer</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="kt">B</span><span class="o">],</span> <span class="n">unchanged</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">List</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="kt">A</span><span class="o">],</span> <span class="n">pending</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">List</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="kt">A</span><span class="o">])</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">List</span><span class="o">[</span><span class="kt">B</span><span class="o">]</span> <span class="k">=</span>
       <span class="o">...</span>
</pre></div>

<p>The bytecode-level counterpart, <code>loop$1()</code>, was emitted as private, as javap output shows:</p>

<pre lang="javap"><code>private final
scala.collection.immutable.List
loop$1(scala.collection.mutable.ListBuffer,
       scala.collection.immutable.List,
       scala.collection.immutable.List,
       scala.Function1);
  ...
</code></pre>

<h2>2.3 GC-savvy closures: Singleton closures, Minimization of closure state</h2>

<p>Some anonymous closures depend only on <code>apply()</code> arguments, for example the char filter function:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>  <span class="k">def</span> <span class="n">deeplyNestedMethod</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">str</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">String</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="o">{</span>
    <span class="n">str</span> <span class="n">filter</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">char</span><span class="k">:</span> <span class="kt">Char</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="k">=&gt;</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">char</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="-Symbol">'a</span><span class="err">'</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="n">char</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="-Symbol">'f</span><span class="err">'</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">char</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="-Symbol">'A</span><span class="err">'</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="n">char</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="-Symbol">'F</span><span class="err">'</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="o">(</span><span class="n">char</span> <span class="o">&gt;=</span> <span class="sc">'0'</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="n">char</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="sc">'9'</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">}</span>
  <span class="o">}</span>
</pre></div>

<p>In these cases, the new optimizer avoids repeated allocations by keeping (in a static field) a singleton-instance that is reused.</p>

<p>After dead-code elimination, closure state comprises only what is actually accessed.</p>

<p>These features are more useful on Android (besides micro-benchmarks) where a vast RAM doesn't masquerade redundant allocations.</p>

</ul><h3>2.4.3 Whole-program optimizations</h3>

<ul>
<li>method inlining</li>
<li>closure inlining</li>
</ul><h1>3 Test driving the new optimizer</h1>

<h2>3.1 How much does it add to compilation time?</h2>

<p>The new optimizer (except the whole-program step) is task-parallel:</p>

<ul>
<li>intra-method optimizations are run in parallel for different methods;</li>
<li>intra-class optimizations are run parallel for different classes</li>
</ul><p>Visually:</p>

<p><img src="http://lampwww.epfl.ch/%7Emagarcia/ScalaCompilerCornerReloaded/yk.png" alt="experimental optimizer uses task parallelism"></p>

<p>There's no reason to limit the worker pool to 8 threads, that's "configurable" at:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre>    <span class="k">val</span> <span class="nc">MAX_THREADS</span> <span class="k">=</span> <span class="n">scala</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">math</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">min</span><span class="o">(</span>
      <span class="mi">32</span><span class="o">,</span>
      <span class="n">java</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">lang</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nc">Runtime</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">getRuntime</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">availableProcessors</span>
    <span class="o">)</span>
</pre></div>

<h2>3.2 Emitted code size</h2>

<p>Let's take scala/scala as case study, compiling src/compiler and src/reflect (on the one hand) and the standard library (on the other) using:</p>

<ol>
<li>GenICode and GenASM.</li>
<li>GenBCode (highlighted).</li>
</ol><p>The new optimizer produces smaller JARs:</p>

<p><img src="http://lampwww.epfl.ch/%7Emagarcia/ScalaCompilerCornerReloaded/SizeComparison.png" alt="jar size comparison"></p>

<p>The above reflects not so much code reductions (in terms of instruction count) but smaller constant pools due to Lean Closure Classes (an LCC just delegates to the class where the anon-closure is instantiated, which usually already has the constant pool entries that under "traditional" closure conversion have to be duplicated in the anon-closure-class).</p>

<p>To benefit from code size reductions as well, <code>-neo:o1</code> (intra-method optimizations) or up will do the trick. Moreover, on a multicore <code>-neo:o1</code> doesn't increase appreciably compilation time, I'm actually thinking making it default.</p>

<p>For example, method <code>driver()</code> in <code>test/files/run/t7181.scala</code> results in:</p>

<ul>
<li>881 instructions, when compiled with <code>-neo:o2 -closurify:delegating</code>
</li>
<li>1004 instructions, when compiled with <code>-neo:GenASM -closurify:traditional -optimise</code> (actually, <code>-optimise</code> increases code size, but the comparison with <code>-neo:o2</code> is fair).</li>
</ul><p>That's 881 vs 1004 instructions and not bytes, which still matters in case you're the one who has to read 881 vs 1004 lines of javap output.</p>

<h2>3.3 Benchmarks</h2>

<p>Feedback is welcome!</p>

<h2>3.4 Speeding up scalac</h2>

<p>Speedups in the range 10% to 20% have been observed against the latest <code>scalac</code>. The upper range is achieved by having a compiler optimized by the new optimizer compile using <code>-neo:GenBCode -closurify:delegating</code> (ie unoptimized compilation, using the new bytecode emitter and Leaner Closure ASTs). Just one data point:</p>

<pre><code>[stopwatch] [locker.comp.timer: 1:43.359 sec]
...
[stopwatch] [quick.comp.timer:  1:32.335 sec]
</code></pre>

<p>Right now the new optimizer alone makes scalac only marginally faster. Instead, the 15% speedup mentioned above is due to the compiler doing less work: (a) Leaner Closure ASTs, (b) the new bytecode emitter, and (c) lower GC overhead. That's normal: <code>scalac</code> is dominated by factors not optimizable (at least not in the short term). Examples abound: </p>

<ul>
<li>millions of <code>::</code> allocated. Neither the old nor the new optimizer are tuned to reduce that.</li>
<li>for deeper insights:  <a href="https://github.com/gkossakowski/scalac-aspects">https://github.com/gkossakowski/scalac-aspects</a>
</li>
<li>actually, tools like Caliper or ScalaMeter, by themselves, tell how much faster sthg runs. When building an optimizer, it's more useful to know "why" stgh runs faster (specially with 20+ optimizations at play). With some work, the toolset that Grzegorz has jumpstarted can provide those insights. </li>
</ul><p>The new optimizer may well make <em>your</em> code run faster. To find out, give it a try.</p>

<li>all <code>ICodeReader</code> bugs (not used anymore)</li>
</ul><h1>4 Getting Started</h1>

<p>The first step is checking out branch <code>GenRefactored58</code> of repository <a href="https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala">https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala</a></p>

<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala.git GenRefactored58
cd GenRefactored58
git checkout -b GenRefactored58 origin/GenRefactored58
ant all.clean &amp;&amp; ant
</code></pre>

<p>After <code>ant all.clean &amp;&amp; ant</code> , a few knobs allow fine tuning: </p>

<ul>
<li>fine grained optimization levels (shown below) to progressively move into more advanced optimizations.</li>
<li>backdoor to use the "old" optimizer and backend, to ease comparison. All options of the "old" optimizer are available in this case ( <code>-optimise</code> <code>-Yinline</code>  <code>-Yinline-handlers</code>  <code>-Yclosure-elim</code>  and <code>-Ydead-code</code> ).</li>
</ul><h2>4.1 Choosing optimization level via compiler flags</h2>

<p>Each optimization level includes all optimizations from lower levels, and assume the new bytecode emitter (<code>GenBCode</code>) is active:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td><code>-neo:GenASM</code></td>   <td>backdoor flag to use the old backend.</td> </tr>
<tr>
<td><code>-neo:GenBCode</code></td> <td>use the new code emitter, just emitting trees as delivered by CleanUp</td> </tr>
<tr>
<td><code>-neo:o1</code></td>       <td>Intra-method optimizations only, ie no inlining, no closure optimizations</td> </tr>
<tr>
<td><code>-neo:o2</code></td>       <td>Intra-program optimizations. This includes any method inlining, closure stack-allocation, or "advanced" closure optimization (ie minimization of closure state, "singletonize" closures) as long as it affects only what's being compiled, as opposed to peeking inside external libraries (see below).</td> </tr>
<tr>
<td><code>-neo:o3</code></td>       <td>Cross-libraries optimization: this includes the same kind of optimization as above, with the caveat that bytecode from external <em>can be parsed</em> if needed to apply some optimization (e.g., this is the optimization level to picks to have <code>Range.foreach</code> inlined)</td> </tr>
</table><p><em>Nota bene</em>: In order to ease migration from old to new optimizer, for now no error is emitted when mixing compiler flags for old and new optimizer. In this case the compiler silently falls back to the old optimizer. This "feature" allows keeping the test suite as is: all those tests asking for <code>-optimise</code> or one of its variants can run without modification.</p>

<h2>4.2 Choosing bytecode-level representation of closures (inner classes vs. method handles)</h2>

<table>
<tr>
<td><code>-closurify:traditional</code></td>   <td>Good ol' dedicated inner class for each closure. Available under GenASM (the only option there), and also with GenBCode but only up to -neo:o1</td> </tr>
<tr>
<td><code>-closurify:delegating</code></td> <td>aka "Late Closure Classes" ie their creation is postponed (instead of UnCurry during GenBCode) thus lowering the working set during compilation. Allows closure-related optimizations (all optimization levels supported)</td> </tr>
</table><h2>4.3 Diagnostics</h2>

<p>Diagnostics are displayed via <code>-Ylog:jvm</code> , for more details add <code>-Yinline-warnings</code> and if that's not enough adding <code>-Ydebug</code> will show both the individual bytecode instructions subject of the message as well as a listing of the enclosing method (all in ASM textual format, which is always available unlike <code>javap</code>).</p>

<p>Another useful flag is <code>-Ygen-asmp &lt;folder&gt;</code> which similar to <code>-Ygen-javap</code> will emit textual files but in ASM format.</p>

</ul><h1>4.4 Pro tip: Optimizing the compiler and standard library themselves</h1>

<p>The minimal-effort way: tweaking <a href="https://github.com/magarciaEPFL/scala/blob/GenRefactored58/src/compiler/scala/tools/nsc/settings/ScalaSettings.scala#L209">this line in <code>ScalaSettings.scala</code></a> followed by <code>ant all.clean &amp;&amp; ant</code></p>

<p>The good-conscience way: An attempt to build a nightly on a clean checkout of branch <code>GenRefactored58</code> doesn't achieve the desired effect, because the old optimizer is used. In fact, the compiler used to compile the new backend doesn't understand (yet) about <code>-neo:o1</code> and such flags. The following steps are needed to overcome all that:</p>

<p>First, update <code>build.xml</code> to the desired level of optimization:</p>

<pre><code>-      &lt;antcall target="@{name}"&gt;&lt;param name="scalac.args.optimise" value="-optimise"/&gt;&lt;/antcall&gt;
+      &lt;antcall target="@{name}"&gt;&lt;param name="scalac.args.optimise" value="-neo:o3"/&gt;&lt;/antcall&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Second, <code>ant all.clean &amp;&amp; ant &amp;&amp; ant replacelocker &amp;&amp; ant nightly</code></p>

<p>The console will show something like:</p>

<pre><code>init:
     . . . 
     [echo]       scalac args: -Yreify-copypaste  -neo:o1
     [echo] scalac quick args: -Yreify-copypaste  -neo:o1 
     . . . 
</code></pre>

<p>The nightly build takes from 80 minutes to 2 hours, depending on hardware.</p>

<h1>5 FAQ</h1>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>What are those Java sources doing in package <code>scala.tools.asm.optimiz</code>?</strong> </li>
</ul><p>Those Java classes are a thin layer of functionality on top of the ASM library, which is written in Java. Package <code>scala.tools.asm.optimiz</code> contains intra-method optimizations which can be performed without knowledge about Scala-level types. The bulk of the optimizer, in constrast, is written in Scala.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>If MethodHandles are slow on JDK7, how come other programming languages are happily using them?</strong></li>
</ul><p>There's no contradiction. Other languages use MethodHandles for what Scala would accomplish via structural types, and in that setting MHs are faster than Java reflection. Instead, the prototype described in Sec. 1.5 leverages MHs in an area far more important to Scala (anonymous closures), and in that setting they don't outperform the (optimized) Lean Closure Classes that the new backend emits. Admittedly, more work is needed, as described in Sec. 1.5.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What about tests?</strong></li>
</ul><p>As Sec. 4.4 shows, the test suite passes under all optimization levels, from <code>-neo:GenBCode</code> to <code>-neo:o1</code> through <code>-neo:o3</code>. It's always possible to include additional tests, for a correct optimizer: <em>they will also pass!</em> Thus if you are not convinced about the correctness argument, how about finding counter-examples? If you find one, please post it at scala-internals for discussion.</p>
